# Text_Tokenizer

This is an interface definition for a tokenizer, to be used by parsers in [Text_Parser](https://github.com/sergiosgc/Text_Parser)

One reference implementation exists in [Text_Tokenizer_Regex](https://github.com/sergiosgc/Text_Tokenizer_Regex)

You probably have no use for this repository outside the scope of writing new Tokenizers for Text_Parser. If you are interested 
in writing a parser for a grammar, you are probably interesed either in 
[Text_Parser_Generator](https://github.com/sergiosgc/Text_Parser_Generator) or in 
[Text_Parser_BNF](https://github.com/sergiosgc/Text_Parser_BNF).
